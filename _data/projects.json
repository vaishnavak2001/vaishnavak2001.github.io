    "documentation": "# Restaurant RAG Agent\n\nThis project implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for a restaurant support agent. It uses LlamaIndex for indexing and retrieval, FastAPI for the backend API, and Next.js for the frontend interface.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.8+\n- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)\n- OpenAI API Key\n\n## Project Structure\n\n- `backend/`: Python FastAPI application with LlamaIndex.\n- `frontend/`: Next.js application.\n- `documents/`: Source documents for the RAG system (restaurant info).\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. Backend Setup\n\n1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:\n    ```bash\n    cd backend\n    ```\n2.  Create a virtual environment (if not already created):\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv venv\n    ```\n3.  Activate the virtual environment:\n    - Windows: `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n    - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`\n4.  Install dependencies:\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n5.  Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and add your OpenAI API Key:\n    ```bash\n    cp .env.example .env\n    # Edit .env and add your key\n    ```\n6.  Run the API server:\n    ```bash\n    python main.py\n    ```\n    The API will run at `http://localhost:8000`.\n\n### 2. Frontend Setup\n\n1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:\n    ```bash\n    cd frontend\n    ```\n2.  Install dependencies:\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n3.  Run the development server:\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n## Features\n\n- **RAG System**: Indexes restaurant information from `documents/restaurant_info.txt` and answers user queries based on that data.\n- **Vector Database**: Uses LlamaIndex's storage context (persisted to disk) to simulate a vector database. In production, this can be easily switched to Weaviate or Pinecone by configuring the `VectorStore` in `backend/rag_engine.py`.\n- **Premium UI**: A modern, responsive chat interface built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.\n\n## Bonus: Voice Mode & WebSockets\n\nThe project includes a \"Voice Mode\" simulation using WebSockets.\n\n1.  **Voice Server**: A separate websocket server is provided in `backend/voice_server.py` to simulate a voice agent backend.\n    ```bash\n    python voice_server.py\n    ```\n    This server listens on `ws://localhost:8765`.\n\n2.  **Bland AI Integration**:\n    To integrate with Bland AI:\n    - Sign up for Bland AI and get an API key.\n    - Use their SDK or API to initiate calls.\n    - The `voice_server.py` can be adapted to handle the websocket stream from Bland AI if using their custom tool/stream features.\n    - In the frontend, the \"Voice Mode\" button is a placeholder for triggering this interaction.\n\n## Customization\n\n- **Data**: Edit `documents/restaurant_info.txt` to change the restaurant's information.\n- **Model**: Change the LLM model in `backend/rag_engine.py` (default is `gpt-3.5-turbo`).\n",

It features robust domain randomization, system identification, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard.\n\n---\n\n##  Table of Contents\n- [Quick Start](#-quick-start)\n- [Project Overview](#-project-overview)\n- [Features](#-features)\n- [Key Concepts](#-key-concepts)\n- [Results & Benchmarks](#-results--benchmarks)\n- [Usage Guide](#-usage-guide)\n- [Documentation](#-documentation)\n- [License](#-license)\n\n---\n\n##  Quick Start\n\n1.  **Clone & Install**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/controlgym-rl.git\n    cd controlgym-rl\n    # Install dependencies (verified on Python 3.13)\n    pip install numpy --upgrade\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    pip install controlgym --no-deps\n    pip install scipy\n    ```\n\n2.  **Run Baseline Training (PPO)**\n    ```bash\n    python src/train_ppo_msd.py --total_timesteps 5000\n    ```\n\n3.  **Launch Dashboard**\n    ```bash\n    streamlit run dashboard/app.py\n    ```\n\n---\n\n##  Project Overview\n\nThe goal of this project is to bridge the gap between **Classical Control Theory** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**. By applying both paradigms to a standard mass-spring-damper system, we evaluate their performance, robustness, and efficiency.\n\n**System Dynamics:**\n$$ m \\ddot{x} + c \\dot{x} + k x = u $$\n\nWe explore how RL agents learn to control this system without prior knowledge of $m, c, k$, and how they compare to LQR controllers that have perfect model knowledge.\n\n---\n\n##  Features\n\n*   **Multi-Algorithm Support:** PPO, SAC, TD3 (Stable-Baselines3) vs PID, LQR.\n*   **Hybrid Control:** RL policy augmented with PID for safety and faster convergence.\n*   **Robustness:** Domain randomization (mass/friction variance) and sensor noise injection.\n*   **System Identification:** Least Squares estimation module to recover physical parameters from data.\n*   **Interactive Dashboard:** Real-time simulation and parameter tuning via Streamlit.\n*   **Automated Benchmarking:** Scripts to generate comparative plots and metrics.\n*   **CI/CD:** Automated smoke tests via GitHub Actions.\n\n---\n\n##  Key Concepts\n\n*   **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization):** An on-policy RL algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation by limiting how much the policy can change in each update. Stable and reliable.\n*   **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic):** An off-policy algorithm that maximizes both expected reward and entropy (randomness). Highly sample-efficient and robust to local optima.\n*   **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative):** The workhorse of industrial control. Computes action based on current error, accumulated error, and rate of change.\n*   **LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator):** An optimal control strategy that minimizes a cost function (state deviation + energy) for linear systems. Requires a known mathematical model.\n*   **MPC (Model Predictive Control):** A control strategy that optimizes a sequence of future actions over a finite horizon. We implement a Sampling-based MPC (Random Shooting) that is robust and solver-free.\n\n---\n\n##  Results & Benchmarks\n\nWe benchmarked controllers on a 300-step simulation task.\n\n| Controller | Total Reward | Tracking Error (Mean) | Robustness |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PID** | -13.88 | 0.1466 m | Moderate |\n| **LQR** | **-21.51** | **0.0546 m** | Low (Model-dependent) |\n| **PPO** | -26.30 | 0.2266 m | **High** (Adaptive) |\n\n*Note: LQR is optimal for the nominal system. PPO learns a competitive policy without knowing the physics and adapts better to disturbances.*\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"controllers/comparison.png\" alt=\"Benchmark Comparison\" width=\"600\">\n</p>\n\n---\n\n##  Usage Guide\n\n### Training\n```bash\n# Train PPO\npython src/train_ppo_msd.py --env_id toy --total_timesteps 10000\n\n# Train SAC with custom hyperparameters\npython src/train_sac_msd.py --learning_rate 0.001 --buffer_size 50000\n```\n\n### Evaluation\n```bash\n# Evaluate trained model\npython src/eval_ppo_msd.py --model_path results/final_model.zip\n\n# Run Comparative Benchmark\npython controllers/benchmark.py --n_steps 500\n```\n\n### System Identification\n```bash\n# Estimate parameters from data\npython system_id/estimate_parameters.py\n```\n\n---\n\n##  Documentation\n\n*   [**Project Summary (One-Pager)**](docs/summary.md)\n*   [**Research Report (PDF)**](report.pdf)\n*   [**Setup Guide**](docs/SETUP.md)\n*   [**Resume Snippets**](docs/resume_snippets.txt)\n\n---\n\n##  License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n**Author:** Vaishnav AK  \n**Contact:** Email: vaishnavak001@gmail.com\n             LinkedIn:vaishnav-ak\n",
