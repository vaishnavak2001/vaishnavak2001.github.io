  I’m Vaishnav AK, an Engineer on a mission to redefine the future of healthcare through AI, Data Science, and Biomedical Innovation.
  
  With a core academic foundation in Applied Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from KTU University, my passion lies in merging the physical world of medical devices with the digital intelligence of machine learning. I specialize in building AI-powered healthcare solutions, applying deep learning, predictive analytics, and biomedical signal processing to solve complex clinical problems.
  
  My journey into Artificial Intelligence and Data Science began with curiosity—driven by a question: How can we use data and algorithms to improve early diagnosis, personalize treatment, and ultimately save lives? This curiosity quickly evolved into structured learning and hands-on experimentation.
  
  To pursue this mission, I enrolled in a Certified Data Science Program (Sept 2023 – July 2024), which provided me with a rigorous foundation in Python, Pandas, NumPy, machine learning algorithms, data visualization, statistics, and model deployment. I didn’t stop there. Understanding the importance of deeper intelligence systems, I further advanced into an AI Expert Program (July 2024 – April 2025), where I focused on deep learning, CNNs, transfer learning, NLP, and AI for medical imaging and signals. During this time, I worked on multiple AI projects specifically targeted at healthcare challenges
  
  In parallel, I was gaining hands-on experience in clinical environments. As a Biomedical Instrumentation Engineer Trainee (since Nov 2024), I have worked in hospital departments dealing with ECG machines, ventilators, defibrillators, patient monitoring systems, and diagnostic imaging equipment. This dual experience in both hardware instrumentation and healthcare data analysis has given me a rare and valuable perspective on the end-to-end healthcare system—from device calibration to disease prediction.
  
  One of the most transformative parts of my journey was my role as a Data Science and AI Consultant Intern at Rubixe® (Oct 2023 – June 2024), an emerging tech company focused on delivering smart AI solutions to global clients. At Rubixe, I Worked on end-to-end data science projects including EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning. Designed and implemented ML pipelines tailored to specific industry requirements, from healthcare prediction models to smart automation tools. Gained exposure to real-world AI deployment challenges, such as handling imbalanced datasets, model interpretability, and data governance. Led a capstone project focused on predictive analytics in health diagnostics, where I collaborated with a team to build a solution that could identify health risk patterns from structured patient datasets. Participated in code reviews, client requirement discussions, and research on cutting-edge tools in deep learning (TensorFlow, Keras) and computer vision. My experience at Rubixe helped solidify my applied AI skills and showed me how to transform theoretical knowledge into scalable, real-world systems.
