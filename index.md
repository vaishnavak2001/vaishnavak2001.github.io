I’m Vaishnav AK, an Engineer on a mission to redefine the future of healthcare through AI, Data Science, and Biomedical Innovation.

With a core academic foundation in Applied Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from KTU University, my passion lies in merging the physical world of medical devices with the digital intelligence of machine learning. I specialize in building AI-powered healthcare solutions, applying deep learning, predictive analytics, and biomedical signal processing to solve complex clinical problems.

My journey into Artificial Intelligence and Data Science began with curiosity—driven by a question: How can we use data and algorithms to improve early diagnosis, personalize treatment, and ultimately save lives? This curiosity quickly evolved into structured learning and hands-on experimentation.

To pursue this mission, I enrolled in a Certified Data Science Program (Sept 2023 – July 2024), which provided me with a rigorous foundation in Python, Pandas, NumPy, machine learning algorithms, data visualization, statistics, and model deployment. I didn’t stop there. Understanding the importance of deeper intelligence systems, I further advanced into an AI Expert Program (July 2024 – April 2025), where I focused on deep learning, CNNs, transfer learning, NLP, and AI for medical imaging and signals. During this time, I worked on multiple AI projects specifically targeted at healthcare challenges.

In parallel, I gained hands-on experience in clinical environments. As a Biomedical Instrumentation Engineer Trainee (since Nov 2024), I’ve worked with hospital departments on ECG machines, ventilators, defibrillators, patient monitors, and imaging systems. This dual expertise in hardware instrumentation and healthcare data analytics offers a rare and valuable end-to-end view of the healthcare ecosystem.

One of the most transformative parts of my journey was my internship as a Data Science and AI Consultant at Rubixe® (Oct 2023 – June 2024), an emerging tech company delivering smart AI solutions to global clients. At Rubixe, I worked on end-to-end data science projects: EDA, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and deployment. I designed ML pipelines for real-world problems, including healthcare diagnostics and smart automation. My capstone project focused on predictive health diagnostics—extracting risk patterns from structured patient data. I also contributed to code reviews, client sessions, and deep learning research (TensorFlow, Keras, CV). This experience shaped my ability to turn AI theory into scalable systems.
